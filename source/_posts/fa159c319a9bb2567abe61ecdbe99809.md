## 前言
前阵子当当网做活动，购买图书有优惠，于是趁机清了一小部分购物车，因而买来了这本心仪已久的《重构》。
虽然到现在还没拆封，有点惭愧= =... 不过找到空闲时间一定要好好拜读一下经典。

## Amazon.com Review
Your class library works, but could it be better? Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code shows how refactoring can make object-oriented code simpler and easier to maintain. Today refactoring requires considerable design know-how, but once tools become available, all programmers should be able to improve their code using refactoring techniques.

Besides an introduction to refactoring, this handbook provides a catalog of dozens of tips for improving code. The best thing about Refactoring is its remarkably clear presentation, along with excellent nuts-and-bolts advice, from object expert Martin Fowler. The author is also an authority on software patterns and UML, and this experience helps make this a better book, one that should be immediately accessible to any intermediate or advanced object-oriented developer. (Just like patterns, each refactoring tip is presented with a simple name, a "motivation," and examples using Java and UML.)

Early chapters stress the importance of testing in successful refactoring. (When you improve code, you have to test to verify that it still works.) After the discussion on how to detect the "smell" of bad code, readers get to the heart of the book, its catalog of over 70 "refactorings"--tips for better and simpler class design. Each tip is illustrated with "before" and "after" code, along with an explanation. Later chapters provide a quick look at refactoring research.

Like software patterns, refactoring may be an idea whose time has come. This groundbreaking title will surely help bring refactoring to the programming mainstream. With its clear advice on a hot new topic, Refactoring is sure to be essential reading for anyone who writes or maintains object-oriented software. --Richard Dragan

Topics Covered: Refactoring, improving software code, redesign, design tips, patterns, unit testing, refactoring research, and tools.

## 豆瓣简介
重构，一言以蔽之，就是在不改变外部行为的前提下，有条不紊地改善代码。多年前，正是本书原版的出版，使重构终于从编程高手们的小圈子走出，成为众多普通程序员日常开发工作中不可或缺的一部分。本书也因此成为与《设计模式》齐名的经典著作，被译为中、德、俄、日等众多语言，在世界范围内畅销不衰。
本书凝聚了软件开发社区专家多年摸索而获得的宝贵经验，拥有不因时光流逝而磨灭的价值。今天，无论是重构本身，业界对重构的理解，还是开发工具对重构的支持力度，都与本书最初出版时不可同日而语，但书中所蕴涵的意味和精华，依然值得反复咀嚼，而且往往能够常读常新。
