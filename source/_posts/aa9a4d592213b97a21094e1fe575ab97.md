The film's name is hidden figures, means that the success of NASA was based on lots of staffs' effort.

The movie Hidden Figures is based in the 60s when women and coloured people were given the `treatment’ in America. More so in places like Virginia where this film is based. Yet three incredible women African-American women Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae), who were brilliant served as the brains at NASA and saw the launch of one of the greatest operations in history: the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, a stunning achievement that restored the nation's confidence. They crossed gender and race lines to inspire generations to dream big.

The most memorable scenes in Theodore Melfi’s Hidden Figures, the new biopic about the black women of NASA’s Langley Research Center, take place not in the starry reaches of outer space, but in and around a women’s bathroom.

In my opinion, the most memorable lines is ‘Every time we have a chance to get ahead, they move the finish line.’ and I learnt from the movie that everyone is equal on the earth, he or she can contribute to our world as other same.
